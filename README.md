6. The second box is for the URLS, and uses an array of JSON, described below. In this example, note we are using a placeholder `{{visitor.id}}`.

7. Optionally enable role restrictions if these URLs are not appropriate for all agents.
8. Once your JSON is in place, click `Install`.
9. Open a new browser to test your results.

If we highlight the `User Info` link, we see the placeholder `visitor.id` has been replaced with the Zendesk end user's ID of `377511204654`.

## JSON Array of URLs:

The following is an example of what can be entered into this app's settings:

```javascript
[
  {
    "title": "First Title",
    "url": "http://example.com/?name={{visitor.name}}"
  }
]

```
This example will generate the following HTML inside the app:
```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://example.com/?name=Robert C.Martin">First Title</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```
